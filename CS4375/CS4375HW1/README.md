I wrote my code and executed it in the Spyder IDE. 

Theres only a single python file here, so just run it. 

Certain combinations of cycles and learning rate will yield nonsense answers/overflow.
I'm not sure how to fix this issue, but it can be avoided by setting a much lower learning
rate if you want more cycles.

part2 uses sklearn to perform the regression, and pandas/numpy for manipulation
